What's the message do you have in your mind? Is it acceptance, peace and love? For me, it's out-of-touch, mentally-ill, and clout-sharks with an identity crisis.\n\nIf we can say that BLM rioting (not to say blm wasn't overwhelmingly peaceful) was considered violence because of destruction of local business and shops, then can't this be extended to cancelling people online or in irl? Setting someone's business on fire isn't that far from getting someone fired from his job due to twitter harassment from trans activist.\n\nAnd let's be honest, these online trans activist aren't exactly shy about advocating for this method of activism. And to go even deeper, as much online as these people are, they do actively take their online extremism to irl, either for clout purposes or for clubs, groups or even co-opting minority groups and gatekeeping them due to difference in ideology even if those differences are minor. Either way, current trans movement for the most part, especially the theme of their movment, have been taken over by online crazies who is trying to push their shit to real life movements.\n\nAdditionally they also gatekeep LGBT people who disagree with them from participating or forming a group to counter them in fear of being cancelled, which is an important factor to have to prove the public that there are trans people who hardline disagree with the current trans movement and aren't just silently or secretly accepting it as it is.\n\nSo imo, due these tactics used, the current trans movement might not be that much different in terms of violenced used as the civil rights movement, it's the just the forms of violence have changed, and it's no less damaging then having things thrown at public figures. Not even sure how many were hospitalized during those days when things were being thrown, tried google searching it but haven't found anything about it, provide link if you find anything.\n\nBut yeah, this is what i believe currently.
